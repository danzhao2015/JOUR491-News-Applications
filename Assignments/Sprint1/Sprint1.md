#Sprint 1: News Trust

Using a story published by a fellow CoJMC student, develop and implement how you might increase the level of reader trust in that story through elements on a new story page.

Your elements must:

1. Be visible on the page. 
2. Be implemented as they might be in a professional news environment.
3. Contain actual, actionable items (links, data, etc) that you can demonstrate.

Some useful materials for you: 

* [Bootstrap components](http://getbootstrap.com/components/)
* [KnightLab SoundCite](https://soundcite.knightlab.com/)
* [JQuery Accordions](https://jqueryui.com/accordion/)

At the end of the sprint, you must present your idea. In your presentation you must:

1. Discuss and define your idea.
2. Based on interviews you did, explain how you think it addds to news trust. 
3. Demonstrate your idea on a page.
