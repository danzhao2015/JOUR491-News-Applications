#Your first news app: UNL's cost#

**Background**

There's a lot of information out there about how much it costs to attend UNL. But how expensive is it, really? And is it a good deal? Using data and visual narrative tools, how might you tell this story? How would you explain to a news audience where UNL fits in the college cost puzzle? You'll want to use the data included in this repository (or hosted on Blackboard) and you should make use of ProPublica's [Debt by Degrees](https://projects.propublica.org/colleges/), [UNL's page](https://projects.propublica.org/colleges/schools/university-of-nebraska-lincoln), [Other Nebraska Colleges and Universities](https://projects.propublica.org/colleges/states/NE).

**Requirements**

1. It must look like a professional news application. 
2. It must include actual journalism. Read about college costs. Read about cost at UNL. Use it in the news app. 
3. It must include data -- At a minimum: one data table, one graphic, one data element using type.
4. It must be hosted on your GitHub.io account. 

**Grading notes**

1. You'll at least in part be graded on the effort you put in. If you take the data, slap it on a page, dump a screenshot of an Excel chart in there and toss some text in, you've at best earned a C. 
2. A handy data visualization tool? [Chartbuilder](https://quartz.github.io/Chartbuilder/)
3. Think about what you'd want to see in a site. Photos? Links to documents or websites? Use them.
4. Having trouble? Remember Slack.
