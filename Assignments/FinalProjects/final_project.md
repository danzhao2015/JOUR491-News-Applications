#JOUR491 News Applications: The Final Project#

You have until Dec. 10 to produce a data-driven news application. The application must be written in Django. It must output to static HTML files. It must be hosted on a GitHub Pages account (your personal account, a group account, your call). It must be fully functional and demonstratable on Dec. 10.

##Your news application must:##

* Be tied to a journalistic story. Your home page must tell a story, and the app must allow for the user to explore. How you define these terms is up to you.
* Use data relevant to your story to give the user something to explore. This data may be something you acquire from somewhere -- like a government entity -- or it might be data you gather yourself. Where and how you get your data is up to you.
* Be professionally designed and presented. You should take advantage of front-end frameworks like Bootstrap, but you should also take the extra care to use the features and design patterns built into them. And you should customize it for your own uses. How it looks is up to you, but it should be to a level where I could share it with a hiring editor to show what you can do.
* Use django-bakery to export your application to static templates. I will provide a tutorial on how to adapt your work to django-bakery, but you can get a start on it by Googling.
* Your news application must also use GitHub to store and track your code and changes to it. I will be grading you on your output -- both the effort you put into it as seen through Git commits and throug the finished product.

You may work on your own, or in a group no larger than 3 people. When polled, the class split evenly between groups, solo or didn't care. So the choice is yours. You can recruit people to your idea, or you can work on it alone. I will be evaluating each person's effort through their Git commit histories. So if you choose to work on a team, you will not be allowed to skip writing code. You will have to be a part of the effort. I will see who is and who isn't contributing.

##The presentation##

On Dec. 10, you must present your news application to the class. You will be required to do three things:

* Demonstrate your news application as it is hosted on your Github Pages account. 
* Describe why you chose to do what you did.
* Explain what you would have done with more time.
* Each member of your team must answer the question: What did you learn doing this? That you are bad at code is not an acceptable answer.
