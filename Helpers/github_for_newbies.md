#Github for newbies

We're going to be using Github a lot for class. If you've never used it before, the best way to describe it is like Google Docs cloud functionality + Word's track changes ability to note everything you do + a database of every change + a social platform for you to interact with people. It takes some getting used to, but once you do, you'll wonder how you worked without it. 

* If you don't already have one, create an account on [Github](https://github.com/)

* If this is your first go with GitHub, use [the desktop client](https://desktop.github.com/). You'll get used to the flow this way with minimal fuss.

* [It's worth reading up how others use Github](http://knightlab.northwestern.edu/2013/06/13/getting-github-why-journalists-should-know-and-use-the-social-coding-site/).

Have this done before class. We'll walk through the rest.
